#Introduction
this app is a Google Play Item description that holds the full Description inside it.

#Problem
Since the description Part can be a Long one it will reserve a big part of the page wich can effect the visibility of other Page Component's,
and so we have to make the userinterface experince better by just make him able to View minimum lines,
and if he is intrested to read the whole discription he will open it by read more link, so we can expand and shrink the subject using on click
